The Times Higher Education (THE) website hosts a wealth of data about universities around the world. Included in the data pool is a ranking of all universities in their database created using sourced metrics such as research environment, teaching standards, and industry impact among others.

This project is concerned with scraping the Times Higher Education website to obtain the global rankings of universities, and then preprocessing the data into a machine-workable format. universityRankingsScraper.py is used to perform the scraping whereas university_data_analysis.ipynb is used to perform the preprocessing. The raw files together with the processed dataset are contained in the "files" directory.
