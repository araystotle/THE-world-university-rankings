The Times Higher Education (THE) website hosts a wealth of data about universities around the world. Included in the data pool is a ranking of all universities in their database created using sourced metrics such as research environment, teaching standards, and industry impact among others.

This project is concerned with scraping the Times Higher Education website to obtain the global rankings of universities, and then preprocessing the data into a machine-workable format. rankings_tab_scraper.py is used to scrape the rankings tab of the website whereas statistics_tab_scraper.py is used to scrape the statistics tab. university_data_preprocessing_2016-2025.ipynb and university_data_preprocessing_2026.ipynb are used to perform the preprocessing. The raw files together with the processed dataset are contained in the "files" directory.
